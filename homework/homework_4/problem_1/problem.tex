\begin{problem}
(40 points) Consider the ODE
\[
\frac{dx}{dt}=v_0+v_1+v_2x^2+v_3x^3
\]
where $v_3\neq0$. Show that this system can be transformed into
\[
\frac{dy}{d\tau}=\mu_0+\mu_1 y -y^3
\]
by setting $x=\alpha y + \beta$ and $t=\gamma\tau$ (affine rescaling of state space, and time scale change). Thus the second system may be regarded as a ``universal unfolding'' of the degenerate system $\dot{x}=-x^3$. Find suitable $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ and derive relationships between the new ($\mu_j$) and old ($v_j$) parameters. Can the number of parameters be further reduced?

Analyze the second (simpler) system an sketch bifurcation diagrams in the form of a surface over the $(\mu_0,\mu_1)$-parameter space, as well as branches of equilibria in $(\mu_1,y)$ space for ``well-chosen'' constant $\mu_0$ slices. Find and indicate stability types of all equilibria.

[\text{Hint:} Start by setting $\mu_0=0$; then move on to small $\mu_0\neq0$.]
